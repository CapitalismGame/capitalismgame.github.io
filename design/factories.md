There will be some kind of automation to manufacture products.
This needs to be done in such a way that it is efficient to simulate it
when the map area is unloaded.

Manufacturing can be done by hand for now, so this doesn't hold up development
yet. A big part of this game will be to scratch the itch of deep automation.
